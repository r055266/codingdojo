Let's use the team folder to put any files/codes that could benefit other developers jumping into the project.

The following folders can be used for the following purposes:

 - database_files: any sql file that may be helpful for running the codes
 - design: any files related to design that could be helpful 
 - ERD: database releationship diagram
 - mock_ups: HTML/CSS/Javascript mock ups files that were developed during the planning stage
 - wireframes: balsamiq wireframes

Feel free to add other folders as you see fit.
